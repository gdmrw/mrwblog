And it is a command line system, though I&amp;rsquo;m not afraid of command but it truly increase the inconvenience for those who just want to make a backup. Most seriously, the way to enter the cmd window won&amp;rsquo;t show up on their readme.md but only in the introduction of the app store, with an very blurry picture.</description>
