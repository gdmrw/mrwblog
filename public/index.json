If you do not already have one, kindly reach out to your ISP for assistance. Please note that if you are unfamiliar with QNAP NAS, this article may not cater to your requirements.\nFor several reasons, you cannot connect to many cloud storage server like google drive in China, which make it difficult to fully function the HBS3(Hybrid Backup Sync). To solve those problem, I add a proxy gateway to my family network and make some configuration to make sQure the Transparent proxy working properly. However, this led to troubles with the Dynamic Domain Name System (DDNS) due to the changes in configuration. This issue had persisted for quite some time until I finally discovered the solution to the mystery.\nInitially, I encountered issues with Myqnapcloud DDNS not functioning despite correctly configuring port forwarding or DMZ on my router. However, upon inspecting the DDNS IP address and comparing it with my public IP, I discovered that they did not match. I was surprised to find that the DDNS was erroneously pointing to my proxy IP. After couples of searches, finally I realized that I was not fully familiar with the working principle of DDNS, and the proxy routing function treated the DDNS server data as a flow requiring proxy, causing the issue.\nIn order to solve the above problems,you need to take the following steps:\n1.Filed a ticket with QNAP to obtain a list of their ddns name servers.\n2.Added these servers to your routing rules to ensure a direct connection when the ddns name server tries to trace the correct IP.\n3.Ensured that the port mapping/port forwarding function is enabled and properly configured in both the router and proxy gateway. This needs to be done twice to ensure that the correct ports are open on both sides.\nhttps://auth.api.myqnapcloud.com https://auth.myqnapcloud.io https://edge.api.myqnapcloud.com https://edge.myqnapcloud.io https://core2.api.myqnapcloud.com https://core2.myqnapcloud.io\nThe above list is what I know QNAP use for DDNS, if no, raise a ticket to ask them again.\nYour myqnapcloud may functioning now. Overall, it is not a formidable cases when you know the running theory of DDNS and Tproxy. Myqnapcloud is a good app, it help me save a lot of configuration step, but at the same time, it also makes me omit some underlying logic of DDNS and hinder me to solve the wrong pointing issue.\n","permalink":"https://examplesite.com/posts/qnap_ddns/","summary":"Prerequisite: Before proceeding, it is essential to have a static public IP.

The risk that will be recongized by proxy will be high.\nIran firewall will reject curl and wget fingerprint request for non-whitelist, Go TLS and browsers fingerprint will be allowed. Recommende to connect by using browser\u0026rsquo;s fingerprint. (Go project uTLS) Note: this repository is disrepair and the chrome fingerprint remain at Chrome 83, it may be a risk. A changable option of the above is here , Chrome 104 fingerprint is currently added.\nServer Name Idication (SNI) Highest risk for free domains, cheap domains will also contain risk.\nTLS connection version TlS v1.3 has the highest risk, all contents after the Server Hello will be all encrypted, middlebox need active detection to obtain server certificate.\nTLS v1.2 will be considered as median risk. All certificates exchange will be in plain text, middle box can verify it through intercept traffic.\nSSL v3/TLS v1.0/TLS v1.1 have the lowest risk , there is few traffic here, in other words, fewer sample. However, using out-dated encryption have risk of being attacked, not recommended.\nTLS server certificate Self-signed certificate have the highest risk. Second are cloudflare certificate and Let\u0026rsquo;s Encrypt because they are free.\nAlmost no people will spent hunders of dollars on certificate.\nReport: New detection method that capable to detect Fake TLS traffic Analysis Both MTPRoto FakeTLS and Shadow TLS(v1/v2) are simulate a TLS handshake with trusted certificate to circumvent whitelist. Both two protocols are nearly perfect, they can be verified as valid client while handshake.\nHow to verify client of MTProto FakeTLS ClientHello package remove ramdom field and make a whole package for hmac, key will be secret, also use the hmac on sevrer to verify client, random have one-time processing, it will fallback to real web server if failed. Indentification method: TLS handshake of MTProto not standardize, firewall can intercept the hostCert package and judge the length. The lenght of hostCert will be ramdon, between 1024-4096 bit. (mtg-faketls)\nShadow TLS v1 won\u0026rsquo;t verify client Identification method: send a request to the sever through curl, curl will failed.\nHow Shadow TLS v2 verify client After client request, sever will return the orgin data as challenge response and use password to hmac. The server can verif the client using same hmac. Due to the return data have randomness and can also achieve one-time verification, middlebox can not react the challenge response if they don\u0026rsquo;t have password, hence, it will be more safer compare with MTproto handshake. New measure to detect client Most protocols security are based on server verify the client, but the client will not verify sever\u0026rsquo;s validity. In other words, one-way authentication Firewall can detect the server reaction by using fake server package. Using reverse dectection to check if the clients are real browser\nMTProto use hmac algorithm in ServerHello and will not affected by this measure.\nHow PoC identify the Shadow TLS v2 protocol desigin Github docs Firewall will intercept a normal TCP connection randomly. After they get TLS ClientHello, they will hijack the request content\u0026rsquo;s SNI field to real SNI server. After the TLS handshake finished, client of Shadow TLS will incert server\u0026rsquo;s challenge response 8 bit before the Application Data.\nAt this moment, because the opposite side is a real real TLS server, handshake with Shadow TLS client will be successful. But afer the hmac sent, server will drop an Alert(Encrypted Application Data) bacause it is not a negotiated TLS encryption. After that, the server will FIN or RST the TCP connection, at this time the ShadowTLS will be identified and can be block by ip precisely.\nProxy procotols will normally use multi connection. Middlebox can precisely identify the client by merely pick one of those connection.\nCurrently recommend proxy protocol Hystertia, TUIC(QUIC) The firewall does not block or interfere with QUIC, so you can use it with confidence. \u0026ldquo;This article is translate from Coia channel ,some emotional expressions have been deleted.
