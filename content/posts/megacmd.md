[Mega CMD](https://github.com/meganz/MEGAcmd) is an software that provide similar function of QNAP [HBS](https://www.qnap.com/en-us/software/hybrid-backup-sync), but I don't know why they can't just integrated their function into HBS. And it is a command line system, though I'm not afraid of command but it truly increase the inconvenience for those who just want to make a backup. Most seriously, the way to enter the cmd window won't show up on their readme.md but only in the introduction of the app store, with an very blurry picture.  That's ridiculous. I hope they can make the doc clearer in the future.
