**Project Objectives**: The project goal is is to benchmark Redis database in different architecture environments, analyze the performance differences and find the root cause of the components and class that cause the performance issue of riscV. Provides reference for optimization options for future servers based on the Risc V architecture.

**Outcome**: The outcome will be a comprehensive report including list of the potencial performance bottleneck points and optimization advisements. This document will help future developers to optimize the performance of RiscV architecture servers and improve overall operating efficiency.

**My Role:** My role is Reasearch Assistance leader

**My Responsibilities:** As a Research Assistant, I spearheaded a collaborative project to optimize Redis performance on RISC-V architecture. Working alongside a team of three, I initiated the project by defining its scope and objectives, ensuring alignment with the professor's vision. Through rigorous testing and analysis, I identified and resolved technical challenges, ultimately developing an automated system that significantly enhanced efficiency and accelerated our research process. My contributions to this project played a pivotal role in advancing our understanding of Redis performance on RISC-V and contributing to the broader field of computer science.

**Deliverables:** As the Result, the provided document will be ultimatily intergrated into research article and will be published well-known academic journals.
